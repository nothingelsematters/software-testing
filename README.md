# Frontend testing

## Main part

+ Create a repository on GitHub, where you can create a `client` folder.
+ In the folder `client` create an application on React / Angular / Vue
  framework of your choice.
+ Requirements for the application: must contain several routing pages,
  must contain a service that communicates with the node.js backend.
+ There are unit, component and e2e tests with a minimum of 1 for each.

## Advanced part

+ The application contains authorization and is not built from generators
  like JHipster.
+ The tests are written to check the authorization.
+ There are several sets of tests (several suites).

## Bonus part

+ Two frameworks of your choice. For example:
  Mocha and Jest or Playwright and Cypress.
+ Write examples with each of the frameworks for your application.
+ A short article or notes on what the main differences seem to be.
+ Make active GitHub pages in your GitHub repository
  and place this article there.

## Questions to test your knowledge

+ Why do you need e2e tests, when you can write component tests?
  What is the difference between e2e and component tests?
+ The terminology of `describe`, `it`, `xit` clear to me
  and I can explain what it is.
+ What is a test runner?
+ A test runner depends on running another test
  (it waits for a certain system state). What could go wrong?
+ `beforeTest()`, `afterTest()` - what for?
+ What are assertion frameworks?
+ Why is it recommended to write some e2e tests?
+ How many tests must there be in one unit test?
+ What are the names of the tests that pass or fail?
  Why does it happen and what to do with them?
